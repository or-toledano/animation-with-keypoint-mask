% Recommended, but optional, packages for figures and better typesetting:

% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)

% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered

\textbf{Paper Deadline:} The deadline for paper submission that is
advertised on the conference website is strict. If your full,
anonymized, submission does not reach us on time, it will not be
considered for publication.

\textbf{Anonymous Submission:} ICML uses double-blind review: no identifying
author information may appear on the title page or in the paper

\textbf{Simultaneous Submission:} ICML will not accept any paper which,
at the time of submission, is under review for another conference or
has already been published. This policy also applies to papers that
overlap substantially in technical content with conference papers
under review or previously published. ICML submissions must not be
submitted to other conferences and journals during ICML's review
period.
%Authors may submit to ICML substantially different versions of journal papers
%that are currently under review by the journal, but not yet accepted
%at the time of submission.
Informal publications, such as technical
reports or papers in workshop proceedings which do not appear in
print, do not fall under these restrictions.

\medskip


It is a zero following the ``-G'', which tells dvips to use
the config.pdf file. Newer \TeX\ distributions don't always need this
option.

Using \texttt{pdflatex} rather than \texttt{latex}, often gives better
results. This program avoids the Type-3 font problem, and supports more
advanced features in the \texttt{microtype} package.

\textbf{Graphics files} should be a reasonable size, and included from
an appropriate format. Use vector formats (.eps/.pdf) for plots,
lossless bitmap formats (.png) for raster graphics with sharp lines, and
jpeg for photo-like images.

The style file uses the \texttt{hyperref} package to make clickable
links in documents. If this causes problems for you, add
\texttt{nohyperref} as one of the options to the \texttt{icml2021}
usepackage statement.

\subsubsection{Camera-Ready Author Information}
\label{final author}

If a paper is accepted, a final camera-ready copy must be prepared.
\subsection{Abstract}

The paper abstract should begin in the left column,

\subsubsection{Paragraphs and Footnotes}

Within each section or subsection, you should further partition the
paper into paragraphs. Do not indent the first line of a given
paragraph, but insert a blank line between succeeding ones.

You can use footnotes\footnote{Footnotes
should be complete sentences.} to provide readers with additional
information about a topic without interrupting the flow of the paper.
Indicate footnotes with a number in the text where the point is most
relevant. Place the footnote in 9~point type at the bottom of the
column in which it appears. Precede the first footnote in a column
with a horizontal rule of 0.8~inches.\footnote{Multiple footnotes can
appear in each column, in the same order as they appear in the text,
but spread them across columns and pages if possible.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Figures}

emph{after} the graphics, with at least 0.1~inches of space before
the caption and 0.1~inches after it, as in
9~point type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which
case it should be flush left. You may float figures to the top or
bottom of a column, and you may set wide figures across both columns
(use the environment \texttt{figure*} in \LaTeX). Always place
two-column figures at the top or bottom of the page.

\subsection{Algorithms}

If you are using \LaTeX, please use the ``algorithm'' and ``algorithmic''
environments to format pseudocode. These require
the corresponding stylefiles, algorithm.sty and
algorithmic.sty, which are supplied with this package.


\subsection{Tables}

You may also want to include tables that summarize material. Like
figures, these should be centered, legible, and numbered consecutively.
However, place the title \emph{above} the table with at least
0.1~inches of space before the title and the same after it, as in
Table~\ref{sample-table}. The table title should be set in 9~point
type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which case it
should be flush left.

% Note use of \abovespace and \belowspace to get reasonable spacing
% above and below tabular lines.

Tables contain textual material, whereas figures contain graphical material.
Specify the contents of each row and column in the table's topmost
row. Again, you may float tables to a column's top or bottom, and set
wide tables across both columns. Place two-column tables at the
top or bottom of the page.

\section*{Software and Data}

If a paper is accepted, we strongly encourage the publication of software and data with the
camera-ready version of the paper whenever appropriate. This can be
done by including a URL in the camera-ready copy. However, \textbf{do not}
include URLs that reveal your institution or identity in your
submission for review. Instead, provide an anonymous URL or upload
the material as ``Supplementary Material'' into the CMT reviewing
system. Note that reviewers are not required to look at this material
when writing their review.

% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
% \nocite{langley00}
